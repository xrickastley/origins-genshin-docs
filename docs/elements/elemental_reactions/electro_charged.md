# Electro-Charged

[Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md)

Electro-Charged is the [Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md) triggered when <span class="electro">**Electro**</span> is applied onto an entity already affected by <span class="hydro">**Hydro**</span> or vice versa.

This reaction deals <span class="electro">**Electro DMG**</span> over time to the Electro-Charged entity. 

Electro-Charged does not apply <span class="electro">**Electro**</span> to any targets hit, and therefore, cannot trigger any further elemental reactions.
