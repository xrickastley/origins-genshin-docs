# Overloaded

[Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md)

Overloaded is the [Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md) triggered when <span class="electro">**Electro**</span> is applied onto an entity already affected by <span class="pyro">**Pyro**</span> or vice versa.

This reaction causes an explosion of power **2.5** and deals <span class="pyro">**AoE Pyro DMG**</span> to all entities within the approximately **5m** explosion radius excluding the entity triggering the reaction.

Overloaded does not apply <span class="pyro">**Pyro**</span> to any targets hit, and therefore, cannot trigger any further elemental reactions.

!!! tip
	You can disable <span style="color: #fc7fa4">**Overloaded**</span> from destroying blocks by setting the `overloadedBlockDestruction` gamerule to `false`.
