# Swirl

[Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md)

Swirl is the [Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md) triggered when <span class="anemo">**Anemo**</span> is applied onto an entity already affected by <span class="pyro">**Pyro**</span>/<span class="electro">**Electro**</span>/<span class="hydro">**Hydro**</span>/<span class="cryo">**Cryo**</span>.

This reaction applies the involved non-<span class="anemo">**Anemo**</span> element to all entities within a **5m** radius excluding the entity the reaction was triggered on. <span class="pyro">**Pyro**</span>, <span class="electro">**Electro**</span> and <span class="cryo">**Cryo**</span> Swirl will also deal **AoE DMG** of the involved element, including the entity the reaction was triggered on, while <span class="hydro">**Hydro**</span> Swirl only spreads the <span class="hydro">**Hydro**</span> aura and deals DMG to the target that the reaction was triggered upon.
