# Superconduct

[Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md)

Superconduct is the [Elemental Reaction](../elemental_reactions.md) triggered when <span class="electro">**Electro**</span> is applied onto an entity already affected by <span class="cryo">**Cryo**</span> or vice versa.

This reaction deals <span class="cryo">**AoE Cryo DMG**</span> in a **5m** radius and applies the "Superconduct" Status Effect to all entities excluding the entity triggering the reaction, which reduces their **Physical RES** by **40%** for **12** seconds.

Superconduct does not apply <span class="cryo">**Cryo**</span> to any targets hit, and therefore, cannot trigger any further elemental reactions.
